Quick and dirty clone of fvid[1], with C and shell scripts.  Not exactly
compatible with it, though.

# Building

$ make

# Installation

No.

# Usage

data2ff, ff2data - convert between data and farbfeld image, each black
	and white pixel representing a single bit.

ff2png, png2ff - convert between farbfeld image and png.

encode.sh, decode.sh - example scripts for converting between data
and video:

$ ./encode.sh input_data.file output_video.mp4
$ ./decode.sh input_video.mp4 output_data.file

It is advised to put your data into a tar archive before encoding.
You can also compress or encrypt it as well, while you are at it.

# Troubleshooting

During testing it was discovered that video compression might ruin
encoded data at high framerates. Keep it reasonably low (fps=1 seems to
work), or configure ffmpeg to encode losslessly.

Video hosting sites might reencode videos and change their framerates.
Make sure fps settings of ffmpeg match when encoding and decoding.

util.c, util.h, ff2png.c and png2ff.c are originally from farbfeld[2]
distribution.
